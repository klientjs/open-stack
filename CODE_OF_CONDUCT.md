# Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct will be approached by the project maintainers and asked to correct their behavior. If inappropriate behavior persists, the individual will be permanently removed from the community.

Our code of conduct includes, but is not limited to, the following behaviors:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language.
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
* Focusing on what is best for the community.
* Showing empathy towards other community members.
* Being mindful of your surroundings and your fellow participants.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Harassment or discrimination of any kind, including sexual harassment.
* Verbal abuse, derogatory comments, or personal attacks.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

If you witness or experience any unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify us by contacting the project maintainers via email. All reports will be kept confidential.

We are all expected to follow these rules in all aspects of the project, including but not limited to project-related events, online forums, and social media.
